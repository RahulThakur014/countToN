-> The main method is the entry point of the program.

-> A Scanner object (sc) is created to read user input.

-> The program prompts the user with "Count up to:" and reads an integer input (number) using sc.nextInt().

-> The Scanner object is closed with sc.close() to prevent resource leaks.

-> An object of the CountToN class (counter) is created.

-> The method num(number) is called on this object, passing the user's input (number).

-> After counting, the program prints "Thank you :)"
